#Welcome

We are Valor Software and we're bringing you ng2-bootstrap, Angular 2 implementation of Angular UI Bootstrap library.

#Why even use bootstrap?
***Itâ€™s easy to use***: Getting started with Bootstrap is a pretty quick and easy process

***Faster development***: There are many ready-made components and resources available, it can significantly speed up your development process.

***Easy integration***: Bootstrap can be integrated with a variety of other frameworks and platforms, on both new sites and existing ones. You can even use just specific elements of Bootstrap alongside your existing CSS.

***Styling options***: Bootstrap comes with base styles for all soon-to-be-modular components with an ability to create your own unique styles.

***Excellent documentation***: We hired a technical writer, so Bootstrap will soon have excellent documentation available, which will be useful for both beginners and more advanced users.


###  "What's special about it, and how it is different from other %bootstrap-thingy%?" you ask. 
Well here's the thing:

- This module consists of native Angular2 components and directives, no jQuery or Bootstrap javascript is required.
- This module works with BOTH bootstrap 3 and 4
- This module plays nice with Bootstrap CSS v3 and v4
- Always latest and greatest Angular 2 support (Angular 2 RC6 atm.)
- Lots of [additional modules](https://github.com/valor-software/ng2-plans), we have.  Herh herh herh.

#Future plans:

- Consistency with Angular 2
- Modularity
- Better documentation
- Test Coverage 
- Code consistency
